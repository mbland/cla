  legal entity, or is under common control with it.

  owner of the open source project(s) in question. His online presence is
  maintained at https://mike-bland.com/ and https://github.com/mbland.

  any modifications or additions to existing work.

## Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to the
Projects’ maintainers, contributors, users and to Mike Bland a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute Your contributions and such derivative works. Except
for this license, You reserve all rights, title, and interest in your
contributions.

## Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to the
Projects’ maintainers, contributors, users and to Mike Bland a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by
your contribution or by combination of your contribution with the project to
which this contribution was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation - including cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit - against You alleging that your contribution or any
project it was submitted to constitutes or is responsible for direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
entity under this agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

## Source of Contribution

Your contribution is either your original creation, based upon previous work
that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
license and you have the right under that license to submit that work with
modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, or you have clearly
identified the source of the contribution and any license or other restriction
(like related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are
personally aware.
